Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to EES 3506 / 5506: Observing and Modeling Climate Change Fall 2025!

All course materials can be downloaded from Repositories > Select Repository > Code > Download ZIP or can be cloned into an your Azure Virtual Machine.

For the purpose of this course, we will be using Azure Virtual Machines which I have already configured with the correct conda environment for our purposes. To run the course outside of an Azure VM, the ees3506_5506 conda environment used can be set up with the .yml located in the setup repo. This assumes one has miniconda & mamba already installed on their system.
